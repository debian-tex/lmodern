lmodern (0.99.3-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * upstream changed some names of font metric files
  * this breaks ConTeXt support in teTeX 3.0 and DVI files using the old names
  * the installed links partly solve this, but (probably) produce
    'checksum error' messages
  * please recreate DVI files using the old names
  * the links will be removed in etch+1
