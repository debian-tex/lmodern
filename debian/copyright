Running t1disasm (from the t1utils package) on the .pfb files yields:

	Generated by MetaType1 (a MetaPost-based engine)
	Supported by DANTE eV, GUST, GUTenberg, NTG, and TUG. 
	METATYPE1/Type 1 version by B. Jackowski & J. M. Nowacki from

	This work has the LPPL maintenance status "maintained".
	The Current Maintainer of this work is Bogus\l{}aw Jackowski and 
	Janusz M. Nowacki.
	This work consists of the files listed in the MANIFEST.txt file.


Upstream file README says:

	The current LM package contains the most recent although still 
	pre-release version of the Latin Modern family of fonts in the 
	PostScript Type 1 and OpenType format. The fonts are based on 
	Donald E. Knuth's Computer Modern fonts in the PostScript Type 1 
	format, released into public domain by the American Mathematical 
	Society (for the history of the outline version of the CM fonts 
	see, e.g., http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/bluesky.html ).

	The Latin Modern fonts can be freely used and distributed under 
	the GUST Font Source License (see above) which is a slightly 
	modified version of the LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL; 
	see http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt )

The GUST Font Source License says:

	% This is a preliminary version, barring acceptance from the LaTeX
	% Project Team and other feedback, of the GUST Font Source License. 
	% This licence is for use with free fonts distributed with source code.
	%  
	% For the most recent version of this license see
	% http://www.gust.org.pl/fonts/licenses/GUST-FONT-SOURCE-LICENSE.txt or
	% http://tug.org/fonts/licenses/GUST-FONT-SOURCE-LICENSE.txt

	This work may be distributed and/or modified under the
	conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3a
	of this license or (at your option) any later version provided that
	the following additional clauses will be observed:

	1) Due to the nature of fonts, clause 6a of the LaTeX Project
	   Public License, version 1.3a, does not apply.  A later version of
	   the LaTeX Project Public License may number or word this clause
	   differently; it is the substance that is important.
	2) It is requested, but not legally required, that derived works be
	   distributed only after changing the names of the fonts comprising 
	   this work and given in the accompanying file MANIFEST.txt, and that
	   the files comprising the Work, as listed in MANIFEST.txt also be
	   given new names. Any exceptions to this request are also
	   given in MANIFEST.txt.
 
	The latest version of the LaTeX Project Public License is in
	  http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
	and version 1.3a or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
	version 2004/10/01 or later.


Please read the appendix below if you want to examine the licensing terms for
the Computer Modern fonts in Type 1 format on which the Latin Modern fonts
are based.

Appendix -- Licensing terms for the Computer Modern fonts in Type 1 format
            on which the Latin Modern fonts are based.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running t1disasm (from the t1utils package) on
/usr/share/texmf/fonts/type1/bluesky/cm/*.pfb and
/usr/share/texmf/fonts/type1/bluesky/cmextra/*.pfb yields:

  Copyright (C) 1997 American Mathematical Society.  All Rights Reserved

  [ Florent Rougon's note: well, for
    /usr/share/texmf/fonts/type1/bluesky/cm/cmb{,sy}10.pfb, you will only get
    one space between "Society." and "All" (with tetex-extra 2.0.2-5.1). ;-) ]

The precise distribution conditions for these fonts can be found in
/usr/share/doc/texmf/fonts/bluesky/README from the tetex-doc package. I will
duplicate here the relevant excerpt for your convenience:

  The PostScript Type 1 implementation of the Computer Modern fonts produced
  by and previously distributed by Blue Sky Research and Y&Y, Inc. are now
  freely available for general use. This has been accomplished through the
  cooperation of a consortium of scientific publishers with Blue Sky Research
  and Y&Y. Members of this consortium include:

        Elsevier Science
        IBM Corporation
        Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)
        Springer-Verlag
        American Mathematical Society (AMS)

  In order to assure the authenticity of these fonts, copyright will be held
  by the American Mathematical Society. This is not meant to restrict in any
  way the legitimate use of the fonts, such as (but not limited to) electronic
  distribution of documents containing these fonts, inclusion of these fonts
  into other public domain or commercial font collections or computer
  applications, use of the outline data to create derivative fonts and/or
  faces, etc. However, the AMS does require that the AMS copyright notice be
  removed from any derivative versions of the fonts which have been altered in
  any way. In addition, to ensure the fidelity of TeX documents using Computer
  Modern fonts, Professor Donald Knuth, creator of the Computer Modern faces,
  has requested that any alterations which yield different font metrics be
  given a different name.
